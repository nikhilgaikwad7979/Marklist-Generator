Marklist Generator

This project is a simple yet efficient Marklist Generator that allows teachers or administrators to input student marks and generate a downloadable marklist.

Input Fields: Users can input student names, roll numbers, and marks in various subjects.
Dynamic Calculation: JavaScript handles the dynamic calculation of total marks and percentage.
PHP Backend: PHP scripts are used to process the form data, calculate the result, and generate the marklist.
